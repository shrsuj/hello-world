Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him.

637,1,"Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"

Another Obstacle would be the Wind, the winds were Shifting because of violent air currents.

21605,8," Laughter is an integral element to many situations. These situations vary greatly, disasters to the desire to be cheered up to simply wanting to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances no matter how grave, terrifying or uneasing. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 made me very worried for my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1 which I at the time I, and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried to the best of our ability to make light of this disaster. Our fears were made even worse when he never logged onto the ning or facebook, but we know now that was just because electricity was down for him that night (night for us). When we learned he was safe, at least for the time being we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped diffuse the situation, as it has many times before. As of now this is still a story in the making because as this is being written there are still great dangers for that region, not the least of which is the threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes are continuing into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation in a way, makes it feel less serious.  Of course many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are legitimately fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring, they, most often, are people with with a sense of humor and a sense of distress.",18,18,,36,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulences’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, I’d lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way we we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, hunny!” my mother teared up as @CAPS6. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there.

That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm",3,4,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY2"

3258,2,"Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad?      It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.     On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them. So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.     Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things. I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.     Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Now a days @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a @NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that. Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical.      In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG3,STY2"

One of the greatest reasons was saftey, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is also highly flammable. Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring.

For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live eaach & every. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1.

My second reason why I say computers benifit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project & all I dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. You will be amazal how much information the computer has.

If something offended you then u wouldnt want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped.     Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good. If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would notjust stand around and do nothing.

It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that.

4562,2,"Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @MONTH1 leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @MONTH1 not see it a something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material.      The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost.      I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. Should we have censored them?     Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation.      The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1,' so is there limit?

Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way.",6,5,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG2,STY2"

4613,2,"To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magzines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive?     I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lotts of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offensive do not understand the materials that they read. For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offensived about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it.      An other reason why could be because we are in america, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. Its fair to say that because well, it is true we has people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offensives them does not mean you can take away the writers material. Doing that is like putting duck tape on the writers mouth. If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the maining of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lott not to talk to a teacher or someone in a highter postition from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer.     Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because has humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammer, the diffrent styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better then @CAPS3 something fun? can not think of anything? well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives.     Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story base on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or leaved out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the librarie's shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the reader's too.     Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelfs is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likly that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikly that it would people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are explambles of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you dont like is still out there.     I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but its better to just turn your head around and move on.The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and thats always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up likeing it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not  learn it.",3,4,,3,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY3"

1688,1,"Dear Local newspaper, I have concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers alot. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they arent enjoy nature and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a posiitve way for their life. In my opinion excercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise. Some people I know don't exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are ""busy"", as they say, uisng the computer to do all there work because they just don't like using the old fashion way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before. Would people be lazy, if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy healthy life. Now-a-days, people don't go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google. They don't see the real thing though. they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But i guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder poeple don't want to leave their homes and if they do leave, don""t worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online. Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your ""mother"", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else and your talking about your, I didn't know, something private and that person on the other computer, ""your mother"", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know waht I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them then they could cause problems. Online isn;t a safe place, thats why you should talk in person not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper for people could exercise, see the nature and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around.",4,4,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY2"

You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter.

271,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of.

Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards.",3,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG2,STY2"

The library offers and array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines and newspapers, but what 'limits' does the library have about the content of those things? All sorts of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at one time in our life. Different crowds of people have different interests that @MONTH1 offend others. The question is, should we limit or rule out certain subjects in libraries?     Limiting or censoring the mass media we have in our libraries would nearly empty them. Truth is, someone, somewhere is going to take offense to the items in most libraries; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college srtudents use these books and diagrams to study, some mothers many find them inappropriate for their young children to see. This is why libraries have seperate sections for different audiences. There could be a childrens section, a 'tween' section, and an adult section to help with this issue. Also, everyone has different interests. I, personally, can not stand rap music but my sister loves it. Eventhough I find some of the things they say in those songs offensive it is my choice to listen to it or not.

3796,2,"Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID1,ORG1,STY1"

4039,2,"Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section. Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age.  Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.     In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section. For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores.     Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.     Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement. So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music.     As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age.",4,4,,4,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit” At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere.

I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and excersize."" I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility.

4677,2,"Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, ect. One parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read then later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and is taken out of the library it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of books being censored.     Everybody might not agree on different subject and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on. A person who @MONTH1 not have children might say, '@CAPS1 one little joke can hurt.' A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might band it from the library.     When a student @MONTH1 need to go to the library to go look up their topic they must research for school and can not find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the @CAPS2. What if their teacher/proffesor said that they needed more then one source and all their information can not just be off the computer they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone they are not able to find the imformation they are looking for.      Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still how do these section keep our children from reading something unaporite. Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls, if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into all they have to do is grab a few books of the shelfs and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls.      Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different point of views, his view might be diffrent from her view. From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents.

Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages, ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand-eye counts."" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings."" @CAPS7 the coordination we aquire from the computer many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When saked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have e-pals. Computer have opened to communicate e-mail, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer there teens to e-mail trends or @CAPS8 as aposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, the phonelines for others and keeps phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finaly, computers can help students learn. In todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. We was greatful for the strain off his back. When asked @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole.",6,6,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ID2,ORG2,STY2"

He had picked @CAPS1 up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked @CAPS1 up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today. Today he was quite, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to @CAPS1 and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood so just stop"".  We were watchingDespicable @CAPS1 for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was @PERSON2's step mom. The were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out to late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear to well and I was paying attention to @PERSON2 to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless then I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he do something to help @CAPS1 decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his step mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON1 had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @PERSON2 jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from @PERSON2's step mom. @PERSON2 got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to @CAPS1, he laid @CAPS1 down and cuddled with @CAPS1.   There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someones crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. @PERSON3 was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, @PERSON2 finally looked at @CAPS1, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dads third wife that had just walked out the door.   ""@CAPS2, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS1 WE will @CAPS3 fight like that?"" I said. I had @CAPS3 heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared @CAPS1, I would @CAPS3 want that kind of thing going on in my house.  ""I promise.""he smiled.  I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled @CAPS1 back down and kissed my nosed, I looked at him and smiled "" @CAPS4, I really really gotta pee.""

When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat.
